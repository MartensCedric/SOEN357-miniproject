# Introduction

The recent rapid technological acceleration in the field of computing has rendered screen-use ubiquitous in everyday life. ScreenSardine’s purpose is to serve as a tool to rid users of their dependence on their computer devices while at the same time helping them invest in their greatest asset: their health.

# Understanding the Problem

It is undeniable that technologies like the internet give us access to an almost never-ending stream of knowledge at the push of a button, mobile phones present us with a great deal of utility in such a small form factor, and computing in general has revolutionized the efficiency and precision that human civilization functions. Despite this, the negative side-effects of screen use have come into focus by the public eye. According to RescueTime, the average person spends over three hours per day on their screen, and according to The Guardian, the average person checks their phone 58 times per day. This phenomenon of digital overconsumption is believed to be exacerbating an already existing global physical and mental health crisis. For instance studies have shown that among many other problems such as anxiety and depression, prolonged screen time usage can also lead to obesity, which has already seen a rise from 9.8% to 29.8% among Canadian adults since 1975 [1]. Therefore as our lives continue to trend towards digitalization, it is more important than ever that we put our phones down, and reprioritize our health/well-being.

# Our Solution

Our solution is to introduce ScreenSardine: a mobile phone application that aims to bring balance in our users’ digital consumption while also promoting habits to improve our users’ physical and mental health. To do so, ScreenSardine is designed as a SuperApp and thus incorporates a myriad of features such as a screen time usage tracker, a macromolecule tracker for dieting, a workout routine platform, a meditation guide platform, a sleep tracker, and more. Our app strives to provide its users everything health related, while gamifying the development of positive habits to create an extra level of engagement and motivation.

## How does it work?

When a user enters the app and logs into their account, they are greeted by their fish tank, which contains their collection of sea creatures. To collect sea creatures, a user must navigate to the Goals tab, and create a new goal while specifying its type and duration. Different goal types yield different types/species of sea creatures. The species depends on the difficulty of the commitment. For example, a three-day commitment of having less than one hour of screen usage per day will grant a sardine, while meditating for 15 minutes for 14 consecutive days on the application’s meditation platform rewards users with a dolphin. Once a goal has been set, a baby version of the sea creature is added to the fish tank. Each day the user stays on track towards their goal, their sea creature grows. Finally, when their goal is completed, their sea creature grows to be an adult and stays permanently in their fish tank. However, if at any time they fail their daily goal requirement before the sea creature reaches adulthood, the sea creature will die and be removed from the tank. The user’s primary objective is to grow the largest and most diversified fauna in their fish tank, which acts as a visual representation of their health. Additionally, when checking up on their goals users have access to the specialized ‘goal activity page’ for this type of activity. Each page is designed to help accomplish this task. So for a meditation goal it would be a meditation timer, for a fitness goal it would be an interactive exercise routine builder, etc…

# Research

## Market Research

There already exist a multitude of applications with the deliberate and specific purpose of reducing or controlling screen usage. Certain apps take a hardline approach to accomplish this. Freedom, for example, allows users to select applications and websites that are deemed unproductive they wish to block during the day. ZenScreen is another application that can be used to set daily phone usage limits or force users to spend 20 minutes off the phone for every 10 minutes spent on it. Other apps use psychological manipulation to reduce screen usage time. Moment is an application that displays analytics of screen usage time, what apps you used as well as provide guided coaching. BreakFree is another app that displays screen usage statistics but also gives users ‘Addiction Scores’. In researching superapps we discovered maybe were related to transport and food delivery like Yandex Go, and Rappi, but nothing currently on the market resembles a superapp with the sole purpose of improving the personal health of its users.

## User Research

To begin our user research, we conducted a short survey on smartphone screen time usage, as well as the importance participants attribute to their health. The survey reflects the need of our users with regards to their health in relation with their smartphone usage, and helped us tailor our app’s features accordingly.
The findings show a clear contrast on the user’s true desire, and what they actually do. For example, it is clear that people use their smartphone a lot. 80% of the respondents look at their phone multiple times per hour, and everyone who answered the survey looks at their phone multiple times per day.

Despite using their phones a lot, 75% of the respondents think their phone usage is detrimental to their health.

It has already been shown that screen usage time before bed is detrimental to sleep [SOURCE : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5839336/]. Many social media apps also exhibit hyper addicting features to maximize the consumption of contents [source (find one)]. While most of this information is already known, people keep using screens excessively even if they are properly informed of the issues regarding their health.
The following survey results show that the respondents want to exercise more, eat healthier and are motivated to pursue a healthier lifestyle.

### Survey Conclusion

It is clear that the respondent thinks that their phone is detrimental, yet they have shown to use it frequently. They have also responded that they want to eat better, exercise more and are motivated to live better. This shows that there is a market for phone addicted users that desire to improve their condition.

# Research Analysis

## Personas

We drew inspiration from our survey results to create three personas. Each persona represents a different archetypal user who has unique goals, frustrations, and backgrounds. These personas provide us with a human understanding of our potential users’ needs and motivations which allowed us to better tailor our application’s features accordingly.

### Amelie Boisvert | Influencer

The first persona is named Amelie Boisvert. She represents our younger demographic who is likely technically-inclined, but also very probably screen addicted. Often screen use is an important means of socialization, self-expression, relaxation, working, etc… So reducing screen usage can entail having to migrate to doing things “the old fashioned way” or to simply not doing them at all which can both be difficult. But hey… “There's an app for that!”. ScreenSardine presents the far less intimidating option of using your screen intelligently to break free from screen addiction.

### Scott Peterson | Unemployed

The second persona is named Scott Peterson. He depicts someone who is severely screen addicted: their addiction being so serious it is a major contributing factor to his declining mental and physical health. Gamification has made Scott addicted to playing video games. Ironically, ScreenSardine will use this very thing to wean him off screen-use, and to improve his overall health.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartensCedric/SOEN357-miniproject/gh-pages/images/persona_scott.png "Persona Scott")

### Thomas Brown | Manager

The final persona is named Thomas Brown. He also represents users who have mental and physical health problems. The key difference being that these issues are deeper-seeded and are not directly caused by screen-use though he is a heavy screen user. The main attraction ScreenSardine will present for this user group is that it is a Super App. It nicely packages tools to help with improving a multitude of aspects of personal health.

## Empathy Map

We created an empathy map in order to clarify the collective needs and pain points of our users by comparing what they say, think, do, and feel. An interesting observation we made was the disparity between the users thoughts and actions. They want to sleep early, they want to be in shape, but they procrastinate, vegetate and pretend to be busy to others. This internal conflict is a negative emotional strain that likely creates stress. This finding tells us that users need to break this mental disconnect by either setting more realistic expectations for themselves, or becoming more productive by reducing the time they procrastinate.

## Journey Map

We created a journey map in order to gain understanding of our user’s thoughts and emotions at different points in time of the adoption process. The journey map demonstrates the process of how one of our archetypes, Amélie Boisvert transforms from having unhealthy screen time habits to adopting ScreenSardine.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartensCedric/SOEN357-miniproject/gh-pages/images/journey_map.png "Journey Map")

## Storyboard

We created a storyboard so we could work through a personal development story-arc of our users. This allowed us to experiment with the way users would interact with the application and elaborate on how these interactions would affect them. For example, when their fish grows they feel motivated, when their fish die they feel regret, and when their fish reach adulthood they feel pride.

# Design Process

## User flow diagram

The user flow diagram visually showcases the user flow for the main activities of the app, which are to set and complete goals while being able to view one’s progress. The central page for the application is the fish tank view. It acts as a central hub for accessing the other views (viewing goals, accessing user profile settings, etc…). We designed the app’s navigation this way so as to improve findability: if the user wishes to find something, there is one central location to look for it.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartensCedric/SOEN357-miniproject/gh-pages/images/design_flow.jpg "User flow")

## Sketches

The following sketches were designed as a very rough draft of the user interface during the design process, and were used as a guide to formulate the functionality of each of the main pages. Given that ScreenSardine is a super app in which different goals lead to different features, for the sake of brevity, only the meditation goal was modeled for the sketches and following prototypes.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartensCedric/SOEN357-miniproject/gh-pages/images/sketches.png "Sketches")

## Wireframes

Once we decided what we wanted on each page, we created wireframe diagrams to work out the finalized layout and dimension of these elements. Our wireframes are ‘Hi-Fi’ wireframes, and quite closely resemble our final prototype besides the lack of colour and finalized typography.

## Color Palette

### Initial Colors

Colors were chosen to evoke a calming aquatic atmosphere. Initially, these colors were selected.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartensCedric/SOEN357-miniproject/gh-pages/images/colors_old.png "Old colors")

### Final colors

The second color was changed to create a better contrast. We believe that the comfort and calmness of the colors remain unchanged.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartensCedric/SOEN357-miniproject/gh-pages/images/colors_new.png "New colors")

## Typography

When selecting the font, we wanted to ensure cognitive fluency for the users. We did not want an exotic font. We wanted to evoke a calming familiarity.

## Final Design

### Sign In/Up

Upon launching the application, the user is met with the sign in page. If the user does not yet have an account, they can access the sign up page and register. If the user already has an account and is already signed in, they are redirected to the applications dashboard.

### Fish Tank

The application’s dashboard is the user’s fish tank. Here, a user will be able to see all the different types of fish that they have collected over time. At the top of the page, we chose to also provide the user the ability to view their fish tank from different time frames. This lets the user track their progress through different periods visually. For the final design, it was decided to keep the navigation bar at the bottom of the page for reachability purposes.

### Profile

The following is a simple profile page containing options for a user to set their personal information, their notification configurations, and their other settings. The profile page also allows the user to log out of their account.

### Goals

The goals page is where the user can view the list of their current goals. Each goal illustrates what type of fish they are expected to collect upon completion, the details of the goal, as well as the user’s progression towards completing the goal. At the bottom, there is a button for the user to add a new goal.

### New Goal

The new goal page lets the user define and save a new goal. To do so, the user must simply select the goal type and the goal duration. Once saved, a new goal will appear in the goals page along with the fish this new goal is expected to deliver.

### Specific Goal

From the goals page, a user can select a specific goal from the list which will navigate the application to a page dedicated to that specific goal. This page provides additional information about the goal, such as the goal’s daily progression. Most importantly, from here the user can access the activity that allows them to participate in the goal. In the following example, the goal is related to meditation. Therefore, from this page, the user can access the meditation platform.

### Goal Activity Page - Meditate

The following is a prototype of the meditate page, where a user can listen to audio files of meditation guides.

# Conclusion

## Challenges

The design process of a health oriented super app such as ScreenSardine presented many challenges along the way. More specifically, one challenge in particular was finding a way to justify why ScreenSardine was designed as a super app. In other words, there needed to be a factor that made the application's health related features cohesive with one another without them simply being an amalgamation of different features for the sake of developing a super app. The gamification of healthy habits was the solution to this hurdle, as it rationalizes the extensive variety of features offered by the app. And consequently, the gamification also gives users an additional level of feedback and engagement that can likely enhance their experience.

## Closing Remarks

Our understanding of the problem and our research indicates that a market in need of a solution like ScreenSardine does truly exist. And with the emergence and inevitable adoption of newer technologies like virtual reality, we believe that the existing demand will only grow. Therefore, it is all the more critical now that we regulate our screen time usage and begin reinvesting our wasted time into our health.
