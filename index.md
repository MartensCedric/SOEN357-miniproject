# Introduction
With major strides in software and hardware development, computers in general have become ubiquitous in everyday life, and digital consumption has increased accordingly. ScreenSardine’s purpose is to undo this trend, and to serve as a tool to rid users of their dependence on their mobile devices while helping them invest in their greatest asset: their health.

# Understanding the Problem
It is evident that mobile phones and social media have known a dramatic surge in adoption and have changed the way people connect with one another. However, screen time usage is now trending at an all time high, and its nefarious effects are beginning to show. In fact, according to RescueTime, the average person spends over three hours per day on their screen, and according to The Guardian, the average person checks their phone 58 times per day. This phenomenon of digital overconsumption is believed to be exacerbating an existing physical and mental health crisis. For instance, studies have shown that among many other problems such as anxiety and depression, prolonged screen time usage can also lead to obesity, which has already seen a rise from 9.8% to 29.8% among Canadian adults since 1975 [4]. Therefore, as our lives continue to trend towards digitalization, it is more important than ever that we put our phones down, and reprioritize our health and well-being. 

# Our Solution
Our solution is to introduce ScreenSardine, a mobile application designed as a super app, that aims to bring balance in our users’ digital consumption while also promoting habits to improve our users’ physical and mental health. To do so, ScreenSardine incorporates a myriad of features such as a screen time usage tracker, a macromolecule tracker for dieting, a GPS running tracker, a workout routine platform, a meditation guide platform, and a sleep tracker. ScreenSardine strives to provide its users everything health related, while gamifying the development of positive habits to create an extra level of engagement and feedback.

## How does it work?
When a user enters the app and logs into their account, they are greeted by their fish tank, which contains their collection of sea creatures. To collect sea creatures, a user must navigate to the Goals tab, and create a new goal while specifying its type and duration. Different goal types yield different types/species of sea creatures. The species depends on the difficulty of the commitment. For example, a 3 day commitment of having less than one hour of screen usage per day will grant a sardine, while meditating for 15 minutes for 14 consecutive days on the application’s meditation platform rewards users with a dolphin. Once a goal has been set, a  baby version of the sea creature is added to the fish tank. Each day the user stays on track towards their goal, their sea creature grows.  Finally, when their goal is completed, their sea creature grows to be an adult and stays permanently in their fish tank.  However, if at any time they fail their daily goal requirement before the sea creature reaches adulthood, the sea creature will die and be removed from the tank. The user’s objective is to grow the largest and most diversified fauna in their fish tank, which acts as a visual representation of their health. 

# Research
## Market Research
Presently, there already exist a multitude of applications that exist with the deliberate and specific purpose of reducing or controlling screen usage. Certain apps take a hardline approach to accomplish this.  Freedom, for example, allows users to select applications and websites that are deemed unproductive they wish to block during the day.  ZenScreen is another application that can be used to set daily phone usage limits or force users to spend 20 minutes off the phone for every 10 minutes spent on it.  Other apps use psychological manipulation to reduce screen usage time.  Moment is an application that displays analytics of screen usage time, what apps you used as well as provide guided coaching.  BreakFree is another app that displays screen usage statistics but also gives users ‘Addiction Scores’.  

## User Research

To begin our user research, we conducted a short survey on smartphone screen time usage, as well as the importance participants attribute to their health. The survey reflects the need of our users with regards to their health in relation with their smartphone usage, and helped us tailor our app’s features accordingly.
The findings show a clear contrast on the user’s true desire, and what they actually do. For example, it is clear that people use their smartphone a lot. 80% of the respondents look at their phone multiple times per hour, and everyone who answered the survey looks at their phone multiple times per day.

Despite using their phones a lot, 75% of the respondents think their phone usage is detrimental to their health.

It has already been shown that screen usage time before bed is detrimental to sleep [SOURCE : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5839336/ (to be formatted)]. Many social media apps also exhibit hyper addicting features to maximize the consumption of contents [source (find one)]. While most of this information is already known, people keep using screens excessively even if they are properly informed of the issues regarding their health.

The following survey results show that the respondents want to exercise more, eat healthier and are motivated to pursue a healthier lifestyle.

### Survey Conclusion
It is clear that the respondent thinks that their phone is detrimental, yet they have shown to use it frequently. They have also responded that they want to eat better, exercise more and are motivated to live better. This shows that there is a market for phone addicted users that desire to improve their condition.


# Research Analysis
## Personas
We drew inspiration from our survey results to create three personas.  Each persona represents a different archetypal user who has unique goals, frustrations, and backgrounds.  We created personas in order to build a deep understanding of our users that takes into account the complexities and intricacies that characterize real people.

### Amelie Boisvert | Influence
The first persona is named Amelie Boisvert.  She represents our younger demographic who is likely technically-inclined, but also very probably screen addicted.  Often screen use is an important means of socialization, self-expression, relaxation, working, etc…  So reducing screen usage can entail having to migrate to doing things “the old fashioned way” or to simply not doing them at all which can both be difficult.  But hey… “There's an app for that!”.  ScreenSardine presents the far less intimidating option of using your screen intelligently to break free from screen addiction.

### Scott Peterson | Unemployed
The second persona is named Scott Peterson.  He depicts someone who is severely screen addicted: their addiction being so serious it is a major contributing factor to his declining mental and physical health.  Gamification has made Scott addicted to playing video games.  Ironically, ScreenSardine will use this very thing to wean him off screen-use, and to improve his overall health.

### Thomas Brown | Manager
The final persona is named Thomas Brown. He also represents users who have mental and physical health problems.  The key difference being that these issues are deeper-seeded and are not directly caused by screen-use though he is a heavy screen user.  The main attraction ScreenSardine will present for this user group is that it is a Super App.  It nicely packages  tools to help with improving a multitude of aspects of personal health.

## Empathy Map
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartensCedric/SOEN357-miniproject/gh-pages/images/empathy_map.png "Empathy Map")
The empathy map shows the disparity between the users thoughts and actions. They want to sleep early, they want to be in shape, but they simply procrastinate, idle and pretend to be busy to others. This is a negative emotional strain that creates stress.

## Journey Map
The following journey map demonstrates the process of how one of our archetypes, Amélie Boisvert from having unhealthy screen time habits to adopting ScreenSardine, and shows how they feel and what they are thinking throughout the way. The journey map illustrates a possible user’s motivation for wanting to adopt the ScreenSardine into their daily routine.

## Storyboard
We created a storyboard so we could work through our imagined character development story-arc of our users. This allowed us to experiment with the way users would interact with the application and elaborate on how these interactions would affect them. For example, when their fish grows they feel motivated, when their fish die they feel regret, and when their fish reach adulthood they feel pride.

# Design Process
## User flow diagram
The user flow diagram visually represents the actual functionality of the application.  The bulk of the diagram shows the goal creation flow.  While the items on the right represent the alternate flow of viewing your goals, looking at a detailed view of a specific goal, and accessing the ‘goal activity page’ for a certain activity.  The ‘goal activity page’ is a specially designed page to help accomplish this task.  So for a meditation goal it would be a meditation timer, for a fitness goal it would be an interactive exercise routine builder, etc…  We intentionally designed the application to only have two flows, and to have the fish tank be the main view.

## Sketches
The following sketches were designed as a very rough draft of the user interface during the design process, and were used as a guide to indicate the functionality of each of the main pages. Given that ScreenSardine is a super app in which different goals lead to different features, for the sake of brevity, only the meditation goal was modeled for the sketches and following prototypes.
