# Introduction
With major strides in software and hardware development, computers in general have become ubiquitous in everyday life, and digital consumption has increased accordingly. ScreenSardine’s purpose is to undo this trend, and to serve as a tool to rid users of their dependence on their mobile devices while helping them invest in their greatest asset: their health.

# Understanding the Problem
It is evident that mobile phones and social media have known a dramatic surge in adoption and have changed the way people connect with one another. However, screen time usage is now trending at an all time high, and its nefarious effects are beginning to show. In fact, according to RescueTime, the average person spends over three hours per day on their screen, and according to The Guardian, the average person checks their phone 58 times per day. This phenomenon of digital overconsumption is believed to be exacerbating an existing physical and mental health crisis. For instance, studies have shown that among many other problems such as anxiety and depression, prolonged screen time usage can also lead to obesity, which has already seen a rise from 9.8% to 29.8% among Canadian adults since 1975 [4]. Therefore, as our lives continue to trend towards digitalization, it is more important than ever that we put our phones down, and reprioritize our health and well-being. 

# Our Solution
Our solution is to introduce ScreenSardine, a mobile application designed as a super app, that aims to bring balance in our users’ digital consumption while also promoting habits to improve our users’ physical and mental health. To do so, ScreenSardine incorporates a myriad of features such as a screen time usage tracker, a macromolecule tracker for dieting, a GPS running tracker, a workout routine platform, a meditation guide platform, and a sleep tracker. ScreenSardine strives to provide its users everything health related, while gamifying the development of positive habits to create an extra level of engagement and feedback.

## How does it work?
When a user enters the app and logs into their account, they are greeted by their fish tank, which contains their collection of sea creatures. To collect sea creatures, a user must navigate to the Goals tab, and create a new goal while specifying its type and duration. Different goal types yield different types/species of sea creatures. The species depends on the difficulty of the commitment. For example, a 3 day commitment of having less than one hour of screen usage per day will grant a sardine, while meditating for 15 minutes for 14 consecutive days on the application’s meditation platform rewards users with a dolphin. Once a goal has been set, a  baby version of the sea creature is added to the fish tank. Each day the user stays on track towards their goal, their sea creature grows.  Finally, when their goal is completed, their sea creature grows to be an adult and stays permanently in their fish tank.  However, if at any time they fail their daily goal requirement before the sea creature reaches adulthood, the sea creature will die and be removed from the tank. The user’s objective is to grow the largest and most diversified fauna in their fish tank, which acts as a visual representation of their health. 

# Research
## Market Research
Presently, there already exist a multitude of applications that exist with the deliberate and specific purpose of reducing or controlling screen usage. Certain apps take a hardline approach to accomplish this.  Freedom, for example, allows users to select applications and websites that are deemed unproductive they wish to block during the day.  ZenScreen is another application that can be used to set daily phone usage limits or force users to spend 20 minutes off the phone for every 10 minutes spent on it.  Other apps use psychological manipulation to reduce screen usage time.  Moment is an application that displays analytics of screen usage time, what apps you used as well as provide guided coaching.  BreakFree is another app that displays screen usage statistics but also gives users ‘Addiction Scores’.  

## User Research

To begin our user research, we conducted a short survey on smartphone screen time usage, as well as the importance participants attribute to their health. The survey reflects the need of our users with regards to their health in relation with their smartphone usage, and helped us tailor our app’s features accordingly.
The findings show a clear contrast on the user’s true desire, and what they actually do. For example, it is clear that people use their smartphone a lot. 80% of the respondents look at their phone multiple times per hour, and everyone who answered the survey looks at their phone multiple times per day.

Despite using their phones a lot, 75% of the respondents think their phone usage is detrimental to their health.

It has already been shown that screen usage time before bed is detrimental to sleep [SOURCE : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5839336/ (to be formatted)]. Many social media apps also exhibit hyper addicting features to maximize the consumption of contents [source (find one)]. While most of this information is already known, people keep using screens excessively even if they are properly informed of the issues regarding their health.

The following survey results show that the respondents want to exercise more, eat healthier and are motivated to pursue a healthier lifestyle.
